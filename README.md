## What it does

ContractMatic streamlines contract generation with the help of artificial intelligence. Users can quickly select the type of contract they need, input essential details, and our platform instantly crafts a comprehensive contract. Additionally, with the integration of OpenAI and Azure Text Analytics, users can enhance custom clauses and receive feedback on the tone and content of their contracts. The integration with Dropbox API further simplifies the process by providing an option for document signing.


## Features

**AI Integration:** Seamlessly integrating OpenAI and Azure Text Analytics to provide real-time feedback and enhance the content of contracts was a significant achievement. It not only improved the quality of contracts generated but also offered users insights they might not have received otherwise.

**End-to-End Functionality:** Building a platform that covers the entire contract creation process, from drafting to signing, was no small feat. Our system guides users from the initial steps of selecting the type of contract they need, all the way to the final step of getting it signed through Dropbox.

**Robust Backend Development:** Leveraging our strengths, we developed a robust backend using Flask. This ensures that the platform is scalable, reliable, and can handle a variety of user requests efficiently.

**User-Centric Design:** Even with our challenges in the front end, we prioritized user experience. We made sure the platform is intuitive, straightforward, and caters to both individuals with limited legal knowledge and professionals looking for a quick contract solution.
